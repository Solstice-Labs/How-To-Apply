*("I don't fix bugs - I make them features")*

### **👾 About Me**  
```python
while not accepted_by_solstice:
    code += "more_python()"
    debug_with(whiskey)
```
- **Name:** Neo20044 *(like "The One" but with more segfaults)*  
- **OS:** Arch Linux btw *(I use Vim for everything, even my grocery lists)*  
- **Superpower:** Fixing prod while SSH'd from my phone in a bathroom stall

### **⚡ Tech Stack** *(AKA "Weapons of Mass Compilation")*  

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# My skills in bash because tables are for normies
echo "PYTHON       🐍 9/10 (I write Flask apps that crash poetically)"
echo "LINUX        🐧 8/10 (I rm -rf'd / once. Learned.)"
echo "HTML/CSS     🎨 7/10 (I can center a div...eventually)"
echo "JS/TS        💀 8/10 (I promise my async/await isn't cursed)"
echo "GRAPHICS     🖥️ 6/10 (I make SVG's that give designers nightmares)"
```

### **🚧 Projects That Shouldn't Exist (But Do)**  

Umm.. why is this part compulsory though 🤡

### **🤔 Why Solstice Labs?**  

- I thrive when sleep-deprived (4AM is my creative peak)  
- My idea of "documentation" is yelling into a voice memo  
- I will bring **energy drinks** to the midnight deploy parties  
- I can recite the entire Linux filesystem hierarchy while drunk

### **💥 Final Flex**  
```python
import this
print("Beautiful is better than ugly... but working is better than both")
print("P.S. Hire me and I'll make the coffee machine send Slack alerts")
```
